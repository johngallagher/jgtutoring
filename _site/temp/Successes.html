                </p>
                <p>
                    Our daughter achieved a B in her Highers, which we are over the moon about. We were thoroughly impressed with John throughout and would wholeheartedly recommend him."

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sarah was having difficulty with fractions, and in the first hour John provided a "lightbulb moment" by explaining it to her in a way she could easily understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of John's help over 12 lessons and Sarah's hard work, she passed her Standard Grade Credit, a result we're both very pleased with."
