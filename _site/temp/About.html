<h1>Why Choose Me?</h1>
<h2>I'm Friendly</h2>
<p>I find that students who need help with Maths have been through unhelpful or even traumatising learning experiences. Some are embarrassed about not knowing so called &quot;basic&quot; topics such as times tables or fractions.</p>
<p>I think it's essential that a student feels comfortable talking about what they are struggling with, no matter how &quot;basic&quot; the topic. That's why no area of Maths is taboo in our lessons. And that's why I will make the student feel at ease from the very first lesson.</p>
<h2>I'm Knowledgable</h2>
<p>I've been a Maths tutor since 2006. I've done a Masters degree in Electronic Engineering at a respected red brick University. I know what I'm talking about. And if I don't know the answer to a student's question I'll get back to them with an answer by the next lesson.</p>
<h2>I'm Empathetic</h2>
<p>I was bullied myself at school and found the educational system in many ways harsh and unhelpful to my academic and social development. I understand why so many students are convinced they are &quot;thick&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; despite this being clearly untrue. I provide a supportive, positive learning experience.</p>
<h2>I'm Professional</h2>
<p>Helping you or your child learn is a big responsibility - I take this seriously and ensure my conduct is professional at all times.</p>
<h2>Others Agree</h2>
<p>Other people seem to agree that I offer a decent tutoring service. Go to the <a href="Successes.html">Successes</a> section to read some of their nice comments.</p>
<p>You can find out more about my service on the <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> page.</p></div>
