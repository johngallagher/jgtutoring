  				<h1>Why Choose Me?</h1>
  				<h2>I&#x27;m Friendly</h2>
          <p>I find that students who need help with Maths have been through unhelpful or even traumatising learning experiences. Some are embarrassed about not knowing so called &quot;basic&quot; topics such as times tables or fractions.</p>
          <p>I think it&#x27;s essential that a student feels comfortable talking about what they are struggling with, no matter how &quot;basic&quot; the topic. That&#x27;s why no area of Maths is taboo in our lessons. And that&#x27;s why I will make the student feel at ease from the very first lesson.</p>
  				<h2>I&#x27;m Knowledgable</h2>
          <p>I&#x27;ve done a Masters degree in Electronic Engineering at a respected red brick University and I tutor up to first year degree Maths. I know what I&#x27;m talking about. And if I don&#x27;t know the answer to a student&#x27;s question I&#x27;ll get back to them with an answer by the next lesson.</p>
  				<h2>I&#x27;m Empathetic</h2>
          <p>I was bullied myself at school and found the educational system in many ways harsh and unhelpful to my academic and social development. I understand the kind of pressure that is put on young people. I grasp why so many adults are convinced they are &quot;thick&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; despite this being clearly untrue. I provide a supportive, positive learning experience.</p>
  				<h2>I&#x27;m Professional</h2>

				<h1 id="Homework">Do you give homework?</h1>
  			<div class="column span-8">
  				<p>Practice is an essential part of success with most things and Maths is certainly no exception, so I set homework at the end of every lesson.</p>
          <p>I recognise that students also get homework from school, so I work with you to set a realistic amount.</p>
          <p>If the student has good control over their own learning process, I may not set homework.</p>

        </div>
  			<div class="column span-9 push-1 last">
          <p>I usually set homework from a standard exercise book. This keeps questions plentiful and consistent.</p>

				<h1 id="Attend">What if I can't attend a lesson?</h1>
  			<div class="column span-8">
  				<p>If the student cannot attend a session, I ask that they give me at least 24 hours notice. If this is not possible, the lesson is chargeable.</p>

        </div>

			<div class="box column span-18 last">
				<h1 id="LessonFrequency">How often should I have lessons?</h1>
  			<div class="column span-8">
  				<p>I usually recommend 1 hour of tuition a week. Over several months, this can reap huge rewards.</p>
  				<p>The amount of contact time needed is dependent on a wide range of factors including barriers to learning, the target grade and, most crucially, how close the exams are!</p>
  				<p><a href="#FAQ">Back to FAQ</a></p>
        </div>
  			<div class="column span-9 push-1 last">
          <p>Tuition through the whole academic year may not be suitable and I have tutored students who have really benefited from a small block of lessons (for example, one hour a week over a 6-8 week period).</p>
    		</div>
      </div>

			<div class="box column span-18 last">
				<h1 id="LessonLength">How long is a lesson?</h1>
  			<div class="column span-8">
  				<p>Lessons are usually 1 hour. If the exams are close or if a student feels they would benefit, I have been known to give tutoring in a 2 hour block with a short break in the middle.</p>
  				<p><a href="#FAQ">Back to FAQ</a></p>
        </div>
  			<div class="column span-9 push-1 last">
          <p>However, 2 hours is a long time to be studying Maths intensively and in usual circumstances I would recommend 1 hour sessions.</p>

			<div class="box column span-18 last">
				<h1 id="NoProgress">What if the student doesn't improve?</h1>
  			<div class="column span-8">
          <p>Every student has areas they find difficult, but sometimes a student lacks the basic motivation to do the work. In these cases, there is nothing I can do - the student is always the one who must put in the effort. My role is enabler and facilitator.</p>
  				<p><a href="#FAQ">Back to FAQ</a></p>
        </div>
  			<div class="column span-9 push-1 last">
          <p>In some rare cases, either due to a lack of motivation or other  factors the student may make little or no progress over several weeks. In these cases I will notify the parents as soon as possible and appropriate action can be taken.</p>
